For fixed-length `ARRAY` properties, `noData` must be an array of length `componentCount`. For `VECN` properties, `noData` must be an array of length `N`. For `MATN` propperties, `noData` must be an array of length `N²`. `BOOLEAN` properties may not specify `noData` values. `ENUM` `noData` values must be a valid item name, not an integer value."
