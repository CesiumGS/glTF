      "gltf_detailedDescription": "An unsigned integer whose bits encode a repeating on/off pattern along the line. Bit value 1 indicates a lit (on) segment, and bit value 0 indicates an unlit (off) segment. The least significant bit (bit 0) corresponds to the start of the pattern and represents the first segment drawn along the line. The bit pattern repeats cyclically once all supported bits have been consumed. If a pattern uses fewer bits than the maximum supported width, unused higher bits MUST be set to zero. For example, a value of 0xFFFF produces a solid line, and a value of 0xAAAA produces a dotted line."

The accessor must be SCALAR with a floating-point component type, and its count must match the primitive's vertex count."
