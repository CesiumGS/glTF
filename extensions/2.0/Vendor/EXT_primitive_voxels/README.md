## Dependencies
Written against the glTF 2.0 specification.

## Overview

This extension allows mesh primitives to represent volumetric (voxel) data via custom attributes. Primitives that use this extension must set their `mode` to the constant `0x80000000` (`2147483648`), which is used to indicate voxels.

Typically, glTF mesh primitives use the `POSITION` attribute to store positional mesh data. However, `POSITION` is neither required nor used by this extension. Instead, `EXT_primitive_voxels` relies on the [`EXT_implicit_geometry` extension](../EXT_implicit_geometry/) to describe the shape of the voxel grid.  

```
"primitives": [
  {
    "mode": 2147483648,
    "extensions": {
      "EXT_implicit_geometry": {
        "box": {
          "size": [2, 2, 2]
        }
      },
      "EXT_primitive_voxels": {
          "dimensions": [8, 8, 8],
          "padding": {
            "before": [1, 1, 1],
            "after": [1, 1, 1]
          },
          "attributes": {
            "_TEMPERATURE": 0
          },
      }
    }
  }
]
```

Although voxels are commonly associated with cubic geometry on a box-based grid, this extension allows voxels to be based on other types of grid geometry from `EXT_implicit_geometry`. This includes cylinders and regions, visualized below.

|Box|Cylinder|Region|
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
|![Box Voxel Grid](figures/box.png)|![Cylindrical Voxel Grid](figures/cylinder.png)|![Ellipsoid Voxel Grid](figures/sphere.png)|

Within this geometry, voxels exist inside a bounding volume that conforms to the geometry of the grid. The `dimensions` property refers to the number of subdivisions _within_ this bounding volume. Each value of `dimensions` must be a positive integer.

The relationship between `dimensions` and the grid geometry is explained in detail below.

### Box Grid

A **box** grid is a Cartesian grid defined by `x`, `y`, and `z` axes with equally-sized boxes. A voxel primitive that is based on a box grid may be defined like so:

```
{
"extensions": {
  "EXT_implicit_geometry": {
    "box": {
      "size": [2, 2, 2]
      }
    },
    "EXT_primitive_voxels": {
      "dimensions": [8, 8, 8],
      "attributes": {
        "_TEMPERATURE": 0
      },
    }
  }
}
```

The `dimensions` correspond to the subdivisions of the box along the `x`, `y`, and `z` axes respectively.

These properties may be used to define the scale of the box grid, independent of the `scale` applied by a node. Additionally, the `dimensions` may be non-uniform.

### Cylindrical Grid

A **cylinder** grid is subdivided along the radius, height, and angle ranges of the cylinder, visualized below.

![Cylinder subdivisions](figures/cylinder-subdivisions.png)

The cylinder is aligned with the `y`-axis in the primitive's local space. As such, the `height` is subdivided along that local `y`-axis. Subdivisions along the `radius` are concentric, centered around the `y`-axis and extending outwards. The `angle` is subdivided around the circumference of the cylinder.

A voxel primitive that is based on a cylinder grid may define the `cylinder` property like so:

```
{
"extensions": {
  "EXT_implicit_geometry": {
    "cylinder": {
      "radius": 2,
      "height": 3
      }
    },
    "EXT_primitive_voxels": {
      "dimensions": [8, 8, 8],
      "attributes": {
        "_TEMPERATURE": 0
      },
    }
  }
}
```

### Ellipsoidal Grid

For **ellipsoid** geometry, the `bounds` refer to the section of the ellipsoid that the voxel data occupies. `(-pi, -pi/2, 0)` and `(pi, pi/2, 1)`

 Elements are laid out in memory on a first-axis-contiguous basis. For instance, with box-shaped voxels, the `x` data is contiguous (up to stride).


contains minimum and maximum values along the axes and/or parameters that control the grid's shape. These ranges are interpreted relative to the geometry of the grid, as indicated by the primitive's `mode`.

### Padding

```
 "padding": {
    "before": [1, 1, 1],
    "after": [1, 1, 1]
  }
```

The `padding` property specifies how many rows of attribute data in each dimension come from neighboring grids. This is useful in situations where the primitive represents a single tile in a larger grid, and data from neighboring tiles is needed for non-local effects e.g. trilinear interpolation, blurring, antialiasing. `padding.before` and `padding.after` specify the number of rows before and after the grid in each dimension, e.g. a `padding.before` of 1 and a `padding.after` of 2 in the `y` dimension mean that each series of values in a given `y`-slice is preceded by one value and followed by two.

The padding data must be supplied with the rest of the voxel data - this means if `dimensions` is `[d1, d2, d3]`, `padding.before` is `[b1, b2, b3]`, and `padding.after` is `[a1, a2, a3]`, the attribute must supply `(d1 + a1 + b1)*(d2 + a2 + b2)*(d3 + a3 + b3)` elements.
