## Overview

This extension defines a cylinder-conforming region as an additional shape type for the [`KHR_implicit_shapes`](https://github.com/eoineoineoin/glTF/tree/refs/heads/collisionShapeMerge/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_implicit_shapes) extension. These regions are useful for visualizing real-world data that has been captured by cylindrical sensors.

`EXT_implicit_cylinder_region` extends the `shape` object in `KHR_implicit_shapes`. The `shape.type` should be set to `"cylinder region"`. The properties define a region following the surface of a cylinder between two different radius values.

The cylinder does not need to be completely represented by the volumeâ€”for instance, the region may be hollow inside like a tube. However, an inner radius of `0` results in a completely solid cylinder.

### Details

The cylinder is centered at the origin, where the radius is measured along the `x` and `z` axes. The `height` of the cylinder is aligned with the `y` axis.

A cylinder region may also be confined to a certain angular range. The `minAngle` and `maxAngle` properties define the angles at which the region starts and stops on the cylinder. These angular bounds are given in radians within the range `[-pi, pi]`.
